## Problems

### [DCP-1](/DCP-1.py)

  This problem was recently asked by Google.
  Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

### [DCP-2](/DCP-2.py)

  This problem was asked by Uber.
  Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new
  array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
  Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
  
### [DCP-3](/DCP-3.py)

  This problem was asked by Google.
  Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string,
  and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.
  
### [DCP-4](/DCP-4.py)

  This problem was asked by Stripe.
  Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space.
  In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can
  contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

### [DCP-5](/DCP-5.py)

  This problem was asked by Jane Street.
  cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element
  of that pair. For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.
